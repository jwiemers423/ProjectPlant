Project Plant


Author: Jarett Wiemers


Description:

Project Plant provides an easy to access and edit database for plant care and information. The program allows for users to search, delete, edit and create new entries into the database.
This provides a simple,organized way to store plant care information and build a large database for the user's benefit.


How to use:

Home Screen Instructions
* To access a plant profile, simply doubleclick on the plant you’d like to view in the grid or press the “Enter” key when the desired plant is selected.
* The search bar to the top left of the app allows the user to search for a specific plant by common or scientific name.
* The user can add a new plant profile by clicking the “Add New” button.
* The user can delete a plant profile but clicking the desired plant once, then clicking the “Delete” button or by pressing the “Delete” key.

Plant Information Form Instructions
* To edit the plant profile, select the “Edit Plant” button.
* To return to the home screen, select the “Return Home” button or press the “End” key.

Plant Information Add New/Edit Form
* Add/edit details you want stored for a plant.
* Add a .jpeg image of the plant by pressing the “Browse Image” button and selecting a desired picture saved on your device.
* If editing an existing plant, the user can delete the profile by selecting the “Delete” button.
* The user can return to the home screen by selecting “Return Home” or the “End” key.

Future Udpates:

I plan to add a scheduling/calender funciton for fertilizers/waterings. The application should send notices to the user when they need to tend to their plants.
